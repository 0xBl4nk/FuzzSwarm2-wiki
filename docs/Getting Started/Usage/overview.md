# Usage Overview

FuzzSwarm can perform fuzzing on both **GET** and **POST** requests, with support for wordlists, numeric ranges, custom headers, and more.

At the core of FuzzSwarm, the following components are essential for basic usage:

- **URL**: The target URL where the fuzzing will be performed.
- **Wordlist**: A list of values used to replace placeholders in the URL or POST data.
- **Range**: A numeric range to be used for fuzzing (e.g., for brute-forcing numeric values).
